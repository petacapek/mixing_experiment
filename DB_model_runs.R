#This script is designed to use Dynamic Enenergy Budget theory numerical model
#to undesrtand patterns of carbon mass balance of the mixing experiment.
#The main idea is that the mass balance is biased by the change of conversion factor 
#between chloroform labile organic carbon and microbial biomass.

#Thus, the numerical model that accounts for changes in conversion factor is defined
#and calibrated against data from the experiment conducted with the same soils at the fine 
#temporal scale. The model parameters that explain the changes in conversion factor in time
#are used to fit the model on the data from mixing experiment.

#Model functions are defined in separate files and saved in the folder "Models". This script
#uploads these functions from source files.
